        <h3><em>What is HTML?</em></h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My cat is very grumpy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (paragraph tag) element:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My cat is very grumpy</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
