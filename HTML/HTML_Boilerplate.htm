    <h1><em><u>HTML Boilerplate</u></em></h1>
    <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>

    <p>Here we have:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b><u><em>Doctype - </em></u></b>The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.</li>
        <li><b><u><em>html - </em></u></b>This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
        <li><b><u><em>head - </em></u></b>This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.</li>
        <li><b><u><em>meta - </em></u></b>With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
        <li><b><u><em>title - </em></u></b>This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
        <li><b><u><em>body - </em></u></b>This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
