    <h1><em><u>Hyperlinks</u></em></h1>
    <p><em><b>Hyperlinks</b></em> are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. <em><b>Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.</b></em> Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).</p>
    <p>For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.</p>

    <h3><em><u>Anatomy of a link</u></em></h3>
    <p>A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <b><em>a element</em></b> and using the <b><em>href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target,</em></b> that contains the web address.</p>
