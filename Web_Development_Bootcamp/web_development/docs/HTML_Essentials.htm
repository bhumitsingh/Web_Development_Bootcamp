        <u><h1><em>HTML Essentials</em></h1></u>
        <h3><em>What is HTML?</em></h3>
        <p><b><em>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</em></b> is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.</p> 
        <h4><u><i>Elements</i></u></h4>
        <p>HTML consists of a series of <b><em>elements</em></b>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a <b><em>hyperlink</em></b> to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My cat is very grumpy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (paragraph tag) element:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My cat is very grumpy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <img src="C:\Users\singh\Documents\Bhumit\Web_Development_Bootcamp\HTML\grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Cat Image not available" width="400" height="123">
            <ul>
            <li><b><em>The opening tag:</em></b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><b><em>The content:</em></b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><b><em>The closing tag:</em></b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li></ul>
            <h4><u><i>Void Elements</i></u></h4>
            <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements.</p>
            <h4><u><i>Attributes</i></u></h4>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\singh\Documents\Bhumit\Web_Development_Bootcamp\HTML\grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="Cat Image not available" width="787" height="97.5">
                <p><b><em>Attributes contain extra information about the element</em></b> that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
                <h4><u><i>Nesting Elements</i></u></h4>
                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called <b><em>nesting</em></b>. If we wanted to state that our cat is <b><em>very</em></b> grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a strong element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <b><em>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.</em></b></p>
