    <h1><em><b><u>Document and Website Structure</u></b></em></h1>
    <h3><em><b><u>Basics Sections of a document</u></b></em></h3>
    <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Header:</b>
            <ul>
                Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Navigation bar:</b>
            <ul>
                Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Main Content:</b>
            <ul>
                A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sidebar:</b>
            <ul>
                Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Footer:</b>
            <ul>
                A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em><b><u>HTML layout elements in more detail</u></b></em></h3>
    <p>It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — this is something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot of detail by reading our HTML element reference. For now, these are the main definitions that you should try to understand:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>main is for content unique to this page. Use main only once per page, and put it directly inside body. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.</li>
        <li>article encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).</li>
        <li>section is similar to article, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break article>s up into different sections, or sections up into different articles, depending on the context.</li>
        <li>aside contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).</li>
        <li>header represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of body it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an article or section it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).</li>
        <li>nav contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.</li>
        <li>footer represents a group of end content for a page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em><b><u>Non-semantic wrappers</u></b></em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>div element</b>: div is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning.</li>
        <li><b>span element</b>: span is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning.</li>
    </ul>
