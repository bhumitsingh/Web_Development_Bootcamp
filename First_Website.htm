            <h3><em>Internet</em></h3>
            <p>Internet is a global network of network of networks(Its just a bunch of computers connected together).</p>
            <p>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the 
                Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of 
                networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to 
                global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
                The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked 
                hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and 
                file sharing.</p>

            <p>The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite (also called TCP/IP, 
                based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four 
                conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. 
                At the top is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data 
                structures most appropriate for each application.</p>
